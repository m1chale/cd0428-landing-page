        <h2>Population</h2>
        <p>For many years, Parkstein had an increasing number of inhabitants, which could be explained by the
          designation of building areas in a scenic location, by the immediate proximity to the city of Weiden and
          especially by the settlement of the expanding Winkler group of companies (Witron, FAS, etc.). Since 2000, the
          population development has stagnated.</p>

        <p>Currently, about 2300 people live in the municipality.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Parkstein was probably settled around the year 1000. According to legend, an imperial hunting party had
          noticed the beautiful basalt cone while pursuing a boar, so one of the hunters decided to build Parkstein
          Castle there. The castle at the site was first mentioned in a document in 1053. In 1052 Duke Konrad of Bavaria
          burned down the castle. Emperor Heinrich IV had the imperially owned castle rebuilt at the end of the 11th
          century. Parkstein subsequently had many owners, including Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and the Wittelsbach
          dynasty. Several times, as was common in the Middle Ages, the village was mortgaged.</p>

        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Parkstein is located around the basalt cone of the same name of volcanic origin in the nature park. But do
          not worry the volcano is no longer active for a long time. However, it leaves a unique sight, which attracts
          many visitors and tourists.</p>
